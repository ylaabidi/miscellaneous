You are given an array of integers, which represent the monthly net profits of a company.
The company wants you to look for the longest sequence of chronologically ordered months
that have increasing profit, and return the length. The sequence can include non-adjacent months.

Implement the function longestProfit(data) which takes as input an array of integers (data),
representing a given set of consecutive monthly profit values.

An example input would look like this:
[-1, 9, 0, 8, -5, 6, -24]

Your longestProfit function should return an integer representing the longest sequence of increasing
monthly profits. For the example input above, the function should return 3, as the longest sequence.

The sequence could be any of the following:
[-1, 0, 8]
[-1, 0, 6]
